* The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. 
* This involves building a machine learning pipeline that preprocesses the data, trains a classification model, and evaluates its performance.
* It will focus on using Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers to achieve this goal.
* This is a batch problem with a large dataset, specifically utilizing historical weather data. 
* The dataset, weatherAUS.csv, contains over 140,000 records, which satisfies the requirement of a large dataset with more than 50,000 records.
